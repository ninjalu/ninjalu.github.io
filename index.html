                            <div class="subheading mb-3">A reflection on traditional NLP and BERT, pizza and sour dough</div>
                            <p>Jan 2021</p>
                            <p>Last week I finished the data science and machine learning bootcamp at AiCore. For my capstone project, I worked on a document classification problem assigned by Adarga, an AI startup with a focus on NLP solutions.Having read the task description and faced with a very small training data, I thought to myself: this can only be tackled by traditional NLP methods; training data is too small for BERT for sure.</p>
                            <p>I started handcrafting features based on the intuitions built by reading the documents in a iterative manner, entity counts, document lengths, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. Before long I was getting good validation scores and SVD on TF-IDF sent the test F1 score to 91%. That's great, isn't it?</p>
                            <p>Except I still had plenty time before deadline, and I was not overly happy about my inability to capture the some of the harder-to-extract differences between classes. Things like: the tones, the writing styles, which BERT could well be very good at differienting.</p>
                            <p>Well, I still had time. No harm giving BERT a go, I thought. A couple of hours on an EC2, my test score was 94%. Then RoBERTa, which is trained on a corpus more similar to the training data, sent the score to 96%. Bingo!</p>
                            <p>That's not the end though. BERT takes much longer to train and inference. Explanability is terrible, compared to a neat feature importance produced from traditional NLP. What's the advantage except for a better performance, which some business may decide against in favour of a faster training time and explanability?</p>
                            <p>I think this is essentially a cooking problem.</p>
                            <p>What??? I hear you ask.</p>
                            <p>Think of traditional NLP vs BERT as cooking pizza vs sour dough. Pizza is fast! For most toppings, such as pepperoni and ham, you can just put straight on the bread (presume you are using premade dough). Into the oven it goes for 2 mins. Ping, ready and delicious. However, imagine for the same cooking process, you are then given some raw pepper. That's not going to get cooked in 2 mins, you need to roast it first! You say, hold on a second, I am not stupid. If I see raw peppers, of course I know the extra preprocessing it needs. But that's not what model does after you have deployed it. You might not even notice some new ingredients (raw peppers) has sneaked in! In machine learning lingo, your new data might need extra features to work, and traditional NLP methods will require you to keep an eye on the data as it comes in. Your model's continuing performance depends on it.</p>
                            <p>Now think about sour dough. There is a mother dough you grow in your fridge. Everytime, you take it out, mix with new flour, water, salt, and return a propotion of this mix dough back to the fridge. That's your new sour dough. The secret of deliciousness is not only the mother dough has been allowed to develop, but also has it seen the new ingredients. And this deliciousness carry through to all the food you made with the dough, sour dough bread, pancake, even pizza! BERT is just like that. You can routinely fine tuning your BERT parameters using the new data as it comes in, so it is kept updated on your new documents, writing styles, and vocabularies. All downstream tasks can all benefit from the updated BERT (as long as they are BERT based too), may it be classification or entity recognition, or question answering. Better still, you don't even need labelled data to fine tune BERT, AND you can almost get away with smaller amount of labelled data for downstream tasks because most of the work ('understanding' language) has been done. How good is that?</p>
                            
                            <p>What do you want to cook? Pizza or sour dough?</p>

                            <p>To start my data science journey while taking care of my toddler has been far away from easy or straightfoward. There were excitement, setbacks, persistence, achievements and a lot of lack of sleep. I wouldn't change it for the world! I remember all the moments before I was about to present my work, finished late the night before, I felt proud, exhilerated and inspred. I had spring in my step! To have received positive feedbacks from fellow data scientists was the best. Now I know I can do it! I hope by sharing my <a href="https://medium.com/@luolu.renmin/my-data-science-beginning-807d0b886a34">experience</a>, I can inpire more staying at home mums to go out and embrace your next challenge, whatever it may be. It will be worth it!</p>
